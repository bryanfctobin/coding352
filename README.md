# Coding352 with Friends
This repository is a storage place for our coding exercises. The goal is to use this as a place to commit your personal coding exercises so that others can review it and help you stay on track. For accountability purposes, you should not merge your coding exercises directly into the master. Rather, your work should be in branches for which you can make pull requests as you work or when you are done with an exercise. 


After creating a pull request, please request a review from one of the other collaborators in this project so that they can see what you are working on and merge it into master for you. You should alternate reviewers so that everyone gets a chance to see everyone else's work on a regular basis, and to help inspire us to continue practicing. Your own personal work should be saved in separate folders so that code commits can be merged without conflict.


The talkpyton_days folder contains a README with links to the 100 Days of Code course from TalkPython.fm and a link to the Github repository for the course. If you are working on other courses or exercises, you can create a new folder for that in the root of this repository.


GLHF!
